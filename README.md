# E-commerce Analysis System
## Project Description
The **E-commerce Analysis System** is a comprehensive data analysis solution designed to handle customer segmentation, lookalike modeling, and exploratory data analysis. It consists of three main components:
- **EDA Analysis**: Responsible for data exploration and statistical analysis.
- **Customer Clustering**: Handles customer segmentation using K-means.
- **Lookalike Modeling**: Generates similar customer recommendations.
The system is designed to process customer transaction data, providing valuable business insights through various analytical approaches. The project includes features such as data visualization, metric calculations, and automated reporting.

## Technology and Frameworks Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering and modeling.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

3. Place the data files in the `data/` directory:
- Customers.csv
- Products.csv
- Transactions.csv

## Usage Instructions
1. **EDA Analysis**:
   - Open `Vinay_Borate_EDA.ipynb`
   - Run all cells to generate statistical summaries and visualizations
   - View the generated insights about customer behavior and transactions

2. **Customer Clustering**:
   - Open `Vinay_Borate_Clustering.ipynb`
   - Execute the notebook to perform K-means clustering
   - Analyze the customer segments and Davies-Bouldin Index

3. **Lookalike Modeling**:
   - Open `Vinay_Borate_Lookalike.ipynb`
   - Run the cells to generate customer similarities
   - Check the output file for lookalike recommendations

## Key Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Customer segmentation using K-means clustering
- Lookalike customer identification
- Data visualization and statistical reporting
- Automated metric calculations

## Results and Metrics
- Successfully identified 5 distinct customer segments
- Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.897
- Generated lookalike recommendations for top 20 customers
- Complete data quality with no missing values
- Clear regional distribution analysis
